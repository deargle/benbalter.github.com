Redid all the kitchen cabinets with custom-made doors. Did custom so that we could close the gap that was there previously.

Poplar rails and stiles, birch (?) plywood middles, tongue-and-groove. Cabinet enamel paint.

Took out the old microwave-hood and put in a new range hood that actually vents outdoors now. So much quieter and effective!

Faux extensions to the ceiling.

Under-cabinet lighting.

Took out whatever that florescent light box monstrosity was, and put in LED cans.

Added an extra cabinet into what was previously a void.
