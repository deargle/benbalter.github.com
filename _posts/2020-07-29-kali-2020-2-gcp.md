In a [previous post]({% post_url 2019-11-07-kali-gcp %}), I described how I got kali 2019.3 running
on GCP. I'm preparing for the fall semester, and 2019.3 is giving me troubles
with installing new packages from the kali repos because kali is on the rolling
model and 2019.3 is too old, and won't upgrade without yelling. So I'm rewriting
things to build kali 2020.2 via packer. I'll put notes in this post for what I had
to do to get things ready, including for nested vms on kali.

The effort to get Kali on GCP covered [three commits](https://github.com/deargle/kali-on-gcp/compare/89a731d939e484614c1eea079e3e727fdfd8057a...051648a3ba7540f60e18906bb89668e5893f9ea4).

Summary:
1. The new kali disables a root login by default. I re-enabled it by customizing the preseed.cfg file.
1. I also had to bump the openssh package build. Hopefully this won't be necessary
in future Kali-GCP adaptations, as GCP moves towards supporting later Debian versions.

The nested kali pentest lab is further described, albeit poorly,
[in the github repo](https://github.com/deargle/kali-on-gcp#a-pentesting-lab-within-kali-on-gcp).
