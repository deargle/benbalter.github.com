Not especially exciting, but I just updated my Kali on GCP repo so that it builds
`2021.2`. This time around, I didn't have to downgrade the openssl packages in
order to get gcp-ssh-in-the-browser to work. Maybe that's because the openssl package
that 2021.2 currently uses is _available_ for Debian 10 (although a lower version
is installed by default). Regardless, the only changes I had to make were some
grub-file edits, and installing the google gcp packages.

I dropped packer files for previous Kali builds from the repo, since they no
longer successfully complete the install process, due to how the kali rolling
apt package structure works.
