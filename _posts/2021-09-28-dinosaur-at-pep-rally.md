This is my second appearance at an elementary school pep rally --
I'm trying to find the video from the first one a few years back.

The event below is a pep rally for a jogathon fundraiser, and the flamingos and
a tiger are lined up for a race across the blacktop. The audience includes
grades kindergarten through 6th. The two flamingo-riders had been working the
crowd for about ten minutes previous to the clip, "building a relationship" with
the audience, as my wife puts it. That explains the screams of horror as the
dinosaur feasts on flamingo flesh.

It was literally 100 degrees outside, and the dinosuit inflation fan fell out mid chase. I nearly collided with a basketball hoop pole.
