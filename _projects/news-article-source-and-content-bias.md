title: "A Spoonful of Sugar: Blending Online News Source and Content to Counter Ideological-Alignment News Biases and Encourage Political Group Depolarization"
with: "Valerie Bartelt, Zlatana Nenova, Dennis Galletta"

While the oft-heard moniker "fake news" may be used to claim that an article’s content is factually false, it may also
be used to label articles from sources that are inconsistent with or opposed to the reader’s political ideology, regardless of the
content factuality. Individuals have been shown to be biased against content unaligned with their ideologies, but what of ideological alignment with a publication source's reputation? And furthermore, little is known about what
occurs when a publication source presents content that conflicts with its established reputation. This study uses a within-subject
experimental design with online participants to identify and quantify marginal impacts of reader-source and reader-content ideological alignment. The findings confirm that, holding reader-content alignment constant, individuals' perceptions of an article are biased based on the publication source presenting the content. Suggestions implementable by publication sources and by bias-aware individuals for countering source-related biases are proposed.
