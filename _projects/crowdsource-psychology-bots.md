title: "When Bots Attack: Threat Modeling and Mitigations of Attacks Against Online Behavioral Experiments"
with: "Todd M. Gureckis, Jordan W. Suchow"
---

Psychology and behavioral data is increasingly shifting to being collected online, instead of in brick-and-mortar lab rooms.
However, panic has arisen about the degree to which such data is impacted by "bots", or by malicious actors gaming
the system in order to maximize participation payouts. This paper applies models from cybersecurity -- specifically,
the NIST Cybersecurity Framework's Five Functions -- to systematically evaluate the threat of bots, and to show the
process by which controls can be developed to mitigate identified threats. Several cross-industry controls are suggested,
including the development of machine learning models to detect anomalous participant behavior, aggregated across
participating researchers' data. The behavioral research community can use these models to defend collected data, and to
argue for cross-industry grants to develop novel approaches.
