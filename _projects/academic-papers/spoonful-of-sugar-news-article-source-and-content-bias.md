title: "A Spoonful of Sugar: Blending Online News Source and Content to Counter Ideological-Alignment News Biases and Encourage Political Group Depolarization"
with: "Valerie Bartelt, Zlatana Nenova, Dennis Galletta"
description_short: |
  Anecdotes suggest that political group polarization may impact readers’
  perceptions of news articles so strongly that readers may call articles “fake
  news” solely based on their ideological alignment with the publication source,
  regardless of the article’s content. While researchers have explored
  confirmation bias in social media, studies have not yet teased out the
  differential effects of reader ideological alignment with article content
  (“content-friendliness”) and source (“source-friendliness”) on attitudes,
  beliefs, and intended behaviors. Using a mixed design, 133 MTurk participants
  read and reacted to polarizing news articles, with article-content being
  presented as if from random sources.
