    Be warned though, the README's there are "research notes," which means they are messy.

Accepted for forthcoming open-access publication at MISQ.

This paper is a follow-up to the wildly popular "Enhancing Password Security through Interactive Fear Appeals: A Web-Based Field Experiment", HICSS 2013.

The original data for this paper was collected through a deception protocol on a
website Socwall.com, with password tooltip treatments designed and implemented
by Kirk Ouimet. Later versions of the paper required collecting additional data,
including running a focus group. I re-implemented the password tooltip
treatments in several other website shells -- first for BYU, then for Temple. We
didn't end up using the BYU one to collect more data, but we did use the Temple
one during a focus group run by Tony with students from there. I also
re-implemented the Socwall one -- all three on Heroku.  I initially used the
social engineering toolkit to clone the sites, because I'm cool.
