with: "Dennis Galletta"

Why do employees disregard computer security messages, opening the organization
to potential information security breaches? One research perspective assumes
that humans who fall prey to such attacks solely use automatic information
processing, and therefore, user interfaces (such as Google Chrome browser
security popups and overlays or Microsoft Word security dialogs) must be better
designed to capture and hold attention, and to educate users, to the end that
users more carefully consciously evaluate their information security decisions.
However, this research project takes the view that employees also make monetary
cost-benefit approaches to adhering to or disregarding security messages. It
gathers data using a series of online deception-protocol website experiments,
wherein users are exposed to security messages that interrupt an ostensible
primary task. Psychometric measures of attention, including mouse-cursor
tracking and reaction times, are captured and used to predict security
behaviors. The monetary "cost" of disregarding a security message is
experimentally varied, and its impact on prompting attention and security
behaviors is examined. Survey data and focus group data is also captured to
probe users' thought processes.
