A design-science approach to creating a tool to graph the nomological space of all survey items used
in information systems literature. Applies methods from the domain of topological data analysis to visually graph the
nomological space, based on predicted "distances" between item pairs generated by a machine learning predictive model
trained on a sampling of survey item-pair relationships (distances) coded by domain experts. Besides leading
to insights into already-used IS constructs, the resulting tool can be used to identify placement of new survey items
in context in the nomological space.
