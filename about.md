David Eargle is a business school professor, but secretly he is a computer scientist. His life goal is Automate All The Things.

In his research, Dave studies usable cybersecurity and dark side of information technology usage. Peruse <https://daveeargle.com/vita/>.

He does “full stack” academic development. Besides writing manuscripts, he develops his own online experiment platforms and tools, administering tasks through cloud computing platforms, and doing his own data wrangling, statistical analysis, and visualizations, always somehow exclusively using the latest and greatest technologies. He often ends up contributing back to open-source projects. Check out some of his projects at <https://daveeargle.com/projects>.

Dave creates and teaches cybersecurity and business analytics courses. He developed a cool cybersecurity data analytics program in collaboration with CU’s school of engineering. Take a gander at <https://daveeargle.com/classes>.

He likes [woodworking]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link woodworking/index.md %}), self-hosted internet-of-things electrical engineering, and gardening, preferably all at once.
