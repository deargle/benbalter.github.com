<meta name="description" content="In this lab, you will use Nmap and Nessus to identify and close security vulnerabilities on Metasploitable. Your objective will be to harden this machine against attack to make it less vulnerable. Setup If you’ve finished “Lab: Exploitation”, you can use the Metasploitable VM from that lab to complete this lab. Alternatively, you can create a new Metasploitable VM by importing the .ova a second time. But if you haven’t finished the exploitation lab, don’t perform the steps in this lab on your only Metaspolitable copy. Snapshot the Metasploitable VM Create a snapshot of your Metasploitable VM in case you need to revert to its original state. Do this by highlighting the virtual machine in VirtualBox, and click the “Snapshots button in the top right. Finally, click the “Take a snapshot button.” Closing Ports on Metasploitable 2 For this part of the lab, use the command nmap -p 0-65535 -sV [IP address of Metasploitable VM] to get a list of services. It’s your job to close all ports except for ports 80 (HTTP) and 22 (SSH). Recall that shutting down services is only one way to harden a system. For services deemed essential to business function, you could also harden by applying security patches (i.e., upgrading the software). But for this lab, you will focus on just shutting down unnecessary services. Whenever you are instructed to &#39;edit&#39; a file, you will use a text editor, such as `nano`. See this note on choosing an editor. Log in to metasploitable. The password is “msfadmin”. On Metasploitable 2, become root by typing: sudo su –, then by giving msfadmin’s password when prompted. Use the command netstat -p -l -n | grep [port number] (as root) to find process related to the port you want to close. For help interpreting the output of this command, run netstat -pln without piping to grep and look at the column headers. Use the command ps aux | grep [name of process] to find the id of the process (the PID) that is listening on the port you want to close. For help interpreting the output of ps, run ps aux without piping it to grep, and look at the column headers. You can use the kill command to kill running processes. However, these may be restarted by the system. You need to change the configuration so that the services don’t restart. Most processes are started by the init (or initialization) daemon. The directory /etc/init.d/ has scripts that init uses to start programs when started. You can stop a service by running this command: /etc/init.d/[name of script] stop Or, analogously (but this doesn’t work on metasploitable): service [name of script] stop You can get a good idea of the name of the script to look for in this directory by using your nmap -sV output, and by looking at the output of netstat and ps aux. You can hunt for a likely script candidate by using tab completion. For example, if you had an idea that the ‘tomcat’ process was responsible for running a service, you could type /etc/init.d/tom&lt;tab tab&gt; (tab twice after typing ‘tom’). This will show you a list of everything in the directory that starts with ‘tom’ – or it will autocomplete for you if there is only one script name that starts with ‘tom’. You can permanently prevent a script from starting by using this command: update-rc.d -f [name of script] remove Some gotchas: vsftpd is started by xinetd. Turn this service off by editing /etc/xinetd.d/vsftpd to change the “disable” variable to “yes”. Tell Xinetd to pick up the changes with this command: kill -USR2 [process number of xinetd] Edit /etc/inetd.conf, and comment out all the processes (telnet, tftp, rlogin, rexec, etc.) Then enter the command: /etc/init.d/xinetd restart Postfix is required by Linux. Change it from listening to external connections by editing /etc/postfix/main.cf, and changing the following line: inet_interfaces = all To: inet_interfaces = loopback-only Then restart postfix: /etc/init.d/postfix restart The named DNS service is run by bind9. smdb is run by the samba process. You can also simply remove programs with this command: dpkg -r [name of package] You can get a list of installed packages with this command: dpkg -l.
