_Kepler-mapper is a library implementing the Mapper algorithm in Python. KeplerMapper can be used for visualization of high-dimensional data and 3D point cloud data. KeplerMapper can make use of Scikit-Learn API compatible cluster and scaling algorithms._

_KeplerMapper employs approaches based on the MAPPER algorithm (Singh et al.) as first described in the paper “Topological Methods for the Analysis of High Dimensional Data Sets and 3D Object Recognition”._
