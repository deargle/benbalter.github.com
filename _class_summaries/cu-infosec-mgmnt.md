I taught both an undergraduate and graduate version of this class.

#### Undergraduate, upper-division, honors
- Exploration of human, organizational, and technical domains of information security management.
- self-created hands-on Google Cloud virtual machine labs to teach students to "think like attackers"

#### Graduate, Masters of Business Analytics and MBAs
- Taught within the Masters of Business Analytics - Security track.
- Compared to the ugrad offering, has a stronger focus on specific security behaviors that
  generate data amenable to machine learning -- e.g., post mortem reports from Mandiant and
  the House Oversight Committee (equifax, OPM)
