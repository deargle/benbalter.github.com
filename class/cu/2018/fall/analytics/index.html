This class teaches cutting-edge tools and approaches to the analysis of data, including “big data” and Internet of Things for effective decision-making. The class creates data connoisseurs through hands-on exposure to exploratory and predictive analytics. Communication Heads up! I rely heavily on slack to able to assist you all, and to communicate important information. Ignore slack at your peril! For communication, we will use Slack. Add an account at https://businessanalytics-f18.slack.com/ (install laptop and phone apps so that you get notifications. There is also a desktop client. Use your @colorado.edu email address for instant verification. Technology Requirements You will use Alteryx and DataRobot. Alteryx is installed on all Leeds computers, and on some Engineering school computers. You can optionally also install it on your laptop – I will provide you with a free license. You can install it into Windows (x64) bit, or you can use a virtual machine that I will provide to run it on Mac without having to do bootcamp. See How to Run Alteryx on Canvas. This link includes a list of campus lab computers that have Alteryx installed. DataRobot is browser-based. You get access with a DataRobot Access Card that you purchase.

(Links to an external site.)Links to an external site. Available as Kindle version—note that you do not require a Kindle to read the book. Kindle is available as software for your computer or iPad. Hardcopy also available on Amazon. DataRobot Access Card. (CU bookstore: $105.95, Direct from DataRobot: $80). This will give you access to a lot of computing power that would otherwise bog down your machine, sometimes for days at a time. We use this approach partially because students with expensive computers may in the past have had an unfair advantage in this class and because DataRobot is the premier AutoML on the market.

I distribute a form to assess team participation at the end of the semester. If a major disparity in team contribution is reported, I will adjust team project grades. Classroom Procedures Students are welcome to use laptops in class for note taking and completing class exercises, exclusively. Late Work All assignments and projects are to be submitted on time or early, so plan accordingly. If you have to miss class please submit your assignment early. On VERY rare occasions, an exception may be granted, allowing the student to submit the work late with a 20% penalty. Under no circumstances will anything be accepted more than a week late. Assignments Labs Labs are hands-on learning activities that will be introduced in class and completed outside of class. Labs are typically due one week after they are introduced in class. Exams Exams primarily test conceptual understanding of analytics concepts. The current plan is for you to have two exams: one midterm and one final. Kaggle Projects Kaggle is an online data-analytics competition platform. For these projects, you will go through the data mining process with deliverables comprised of the following: Demonstration of understanding of the business problem and of the data (“business understanding” and “data understanding” stages). Explanation of data preparation, including feature engineering (“data preparation” stage). Development and evaluation of a machine learning model, along with final recommendation to management. The above three components will be delivered in stages. I plan for us to participate in two Kaggle projects over the course of the class, each with its own report.

<h2 id="classroom-policies">Classroom Policies</h2>

<h3 id="participation-policy">Participation Policy</h3>

<p>Contribution will account for 5% of your final grade.  Most students will earn 80% of these points.  Students who are exceptional and go above and beyond in enhancing the classroom experience may receive a higher score.</p>

<p>The following list is not comprehensive, but rather an example of items weighted in the contribution category:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Providing feedback on the class via the course evaluation</li>
  <li>Treating others with respect</li>
  <li>Showing courtesy for presenters (guest speakers, instructor, students)</li>
  <li>Participating in class discussions</li>
  <li>Arriving on time and not leaving early</li>
  <li>Not using technology inappropriately (distracting yourself or others)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="team-work">Team work</h3>

<p>In this class, you will work in teams. As a result, consider reviewing a short report on <a href="/class/general/team_effectiveness.pdf">team effectiveness</a> and establishing a team agreement <a href="/class/general/sample_team_agreement.docx">(sample agreement)</a>.</p>

<h3 id="freeloader-policy">Freeloader policy</h3>

<p>It occasionally happens in class and enterprise settings that someone in a group is not prepared to do his/her share. In the case of my classes, I recommend that the team give the freeloader one warning and then fire that person from the team. That person will then do group assignments individually or find another team to join. The team should notify me of the change in team composition immediately. I distribute a form to assess team participation at the end of the semester. If a major disparity in team contribution is reported, I will adjust team project grades.</p>

<h3 id="classroom-procedures">Classroom Procedures</h3>

<p>Students are welcome to use laptops in class for note taking and completing class exercises, exclusively.</p>

<h3 id="late-work">Late Work</h3>

<p>All assignments and projects are to be submitted on time or early, so plan accordingly. If you have to miss class please submit your assignment early. On VERY rare occasions, an exception may be granted, allowing the student to submit the work late with a 20% penalty. Under no circumstances will anything be accepted more than a week late.</p>

<h1 id="assignments">Assignments</h1>

<h2 id="labs">Labs</h2>

<p>Labs are hands-on learning activities that will be introduced in class and completed outside of class. Labs are typically due one week after they are introduced in class.</p>

<h2 id="exams">Exams</h2>

<p>Exams primarily test conceptual understanding of analytics concepts. The current plan is for you to have two exams: one midterm and one final.</p>

<h2 id="kaggle-projects">Kaggle Projects</h2>

<p>Kaggle is an online data-analytics competition platform. For these projects, you will go through the data mining process with deliverables comprised of the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Demonstration of understanding of the business problem and of the data (“business understanding” and “data understanding” stages).</li>
  <li>Explanation of data preparation, including feature engineering (“data preparation” stage).</li>
  <li>Development and evaluation of a machine learning model, along with final recommendation to management.</li>
</ul>

<p>The above three components will be delivered in stages.</p>

<p>I plan for us to participate in two Kaggle projects over the course of the class, each with its own report. You will work in teams for these projects.</p>
