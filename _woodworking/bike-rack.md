Used fattie 3/8" stainless steel bolts holding that 1x4 to the steel fence posts
that we had laying about.

Then I attached the mate of that 1x4 to the fence runner behind. (1Ã—4 used to be
a 2x4 rough cut cedar)

Idea is that it will morph to become standalone as soon as we get an HOA
unapproved permanent structure notice.

I also didn't want to deal with leveling. I actually started a standalone
structure that I took apart bc leveling problems I didn't want to deal with.

I might also sink wood posts into the ground, but in gravel, not concrete.
