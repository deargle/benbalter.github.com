When I talked in class on physical security day how shredded paper could be pieced back together by a determined attacker, one of my students quipped, "And that's why we feed our shredded paper to our worms." Great idea! So I bought 2000 worms from someone named Uncle Jim on the internet, and made this tiered composting station. Used stained cedar from old playground pieces, and lid made from a mdf tabletop someone was giving away.
