This table was my first attempt at creating panels. I jointed the boards on a
table saw. But I didn't have a very long jig, so I cut all of the pieces shorter
first. Then I butted the boards up against one another long-wise. I
used a bunch of cauls to make up for my lack of sufficient worksurface.

The glue-up was a nightmare! Largely due to my attempt to glue up all 30+ boards at once.
I fixed gaps with a paste of sawdust and glue.

Sanded for hours with a random orbital, and finished with three coats of general
finishes water-based poly.

Later, I'll post a picture of it installed in the window. It does its job! The
table finish holds up well against water drips.
