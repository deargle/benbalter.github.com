I followed plans from
[this excellent blog post](http://mincingthoughts.blogspot.com/2015/07/kids-climbing-play-structure-building.html), although I had to adapt the plans for rough-cut wood dimensions. One of my first times using Sketchup, it was fun.

Cedar fence pickets for the climbing wall boards. 5/8" weren't thick enough to
not bow without an additional backer board running vertically behind all
pickets.

200' of 1/2" cotton rope for the net. Took forever to tie the
knots. Used [carrick bends](https://www.animatedknots.com/carrick-bend-knot).

The whole thing pivots and folds up on the top bolts.

Splintering was a major issue. Short of sanding everything, not sure what the best
way to address would be.

Has since been retired, and appropriated into [a bike rack]({% link _woodworking/bike-rack.md %}) and [a garden trellis]({% link _woodworking/garden-trellis.md %}).
