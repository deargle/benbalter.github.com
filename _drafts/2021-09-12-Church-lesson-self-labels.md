> Hi Dave - a while back you taught our Elder's Quorum lesson and started the lesson by asking us to finish a sentence and write down our response. It was something about how we see ourselves. It seems like it was something like "I am ___________" and then we write a list of what comes to mind for us. Was this how it went?

> I'm doing the youth fireside next Sunday, and am talking about knowing your identity of a beloved son or daughter of God so I was considering doing a similar exercise.

Hi, it was: "I am a ______". It's an exercise from organizational behavioral research. When we did it in EQ, the rules were:

1. In first stage, no filtering, no sorting. It's an exploration exercise, not a self-critique. Whatever comes to mind, write it.

2. In second stage, we reviewed what we had written, and I invited people to share what they had put, if comfortable. Open-ended, no pressure, because if people were honest in part 1, they might have put some things they're not comfortable sharing.

The exercise was a riff off of a quote from one of president oak's talks, the quote was something about how identity labels for ourselves can limit our views of what we can become. That's why it is so important to be honest in part 1, because the goal is to see what identity labels we reactively have for ourselves that we might not realize. A lot of the theological focus in the gospel is on giving us a new identity focus for ourselves, and how the gospel identities can empower us to change. Disciple of Christ, therefore can do all things in his name. First principle of first missionary lesson is Child of God, it's elevating, etc.

Some of the interesting responses I remember from when we ran it:

"I first put I am a father, but then I wanted to cross it out because I'm supposed to be a husband first, not a father first."

"I am a _marine_" as the first response.

"I'm an engineer. But in part two, I reflected that I haven't done any actual engineering in 30 years. Instead, I've only done project management. But how interesting that I still identity as an engineer, regardless."

"I am a Child of God" but yes of course everyone would say that to complete the phrase "I am a \_\_\_\_\_" since it's a reactive association because of the primary song, so I tried not to spend much time on that one.

I asked rhetorically if anyone had put "I am an angry person, I am an impatient person," etc, then referenced Oak's quote about how if that becomes an _identity_, we might never progress past it.

Here's the quote, from Oaks 2019 "where will this lead?":

“Where will this lead?” is also important in choosing how we label or think of ourselves. Most important, each of us is a child of God with a potential destiny of eternal life. Every other label, even including occupation, race, physical characteristics, or honors, is temporary or trivial in eternal terms. Don’t choose to label yourselves or think of yourselves in terms that put a limit on a goal for which you might strive.

>This is great, I think I may steal this if that's alright. I listened to a Devotional talk by the BYU President called "Knowing Who You Are" that I also may pull from. I'm intrigued by the idea that having a solid self-concept as a son or daughter of God can help us be not so impacted by circumstances. Thanks for the reminders on the lesson.

Steal away! I think the key is to talk little, listen a lot, and get them to somehow metacognate, it's an important skill. I'm interested to hear how it goes, good luck.

Oh, predicting the kinds of self-limiting labels they might give themselves, "I'm (not) an athlete, creative, a pretty person, a good speaker, funny, AP student, religious, a confident person." I think they'll think of [attribute] [person]. Anything that would make someone not go for working on some life attribute or other, is limiting. And to your point, without an identity in God, we can be shaken by life. But I'm also big on how identifying as offspring of God helps us strive to develop new godlike attributes in times when we _aren't_ shaken -- when things are okay. Comfort the afflicted, afflict the comfortable I think.

Oh something else someone said in our lesson, "I'm a Christian," because of their workplace conversations. I'm a Mormon, etc. I think the _first_ few things someone writes down are very interesting.
