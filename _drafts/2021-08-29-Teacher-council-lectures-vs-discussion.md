Takeaways:
- several participant felt that lectures are not _memorable_ or _engaging_. While,
  discussions are.
- I argued that lectures have a place, as do discussions. While we may be crummy
  at lectures, we don't have to be.
- discussions may only work if class members have a foundational doctrinal
  understanding to work off of
- discussions can _follow_ teaching the doctrine. Perhaps start with reading
  scriptures or an authoritative quote, and establish understanding of the doctrine. _Then_, ask participants to react to the doctrine.
  - How does knowing *doctrine* or *principle* make you *feel*?
