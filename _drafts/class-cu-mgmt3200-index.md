# Course Information

Welcome to what Harvard Business Review termed the “Sexiest Job of the 21st Century” and Glassdoor named the “best job of the year” for 2016. This class teaches cutting-edge tools and approaches to the analysis of data, including "big data" and Internet of Things for effective decision-making. The class creates data connoisseurs through hands-on exposure to exploratory and predictive analytics. Application areas covered include Web Marketing, the Internet of Things, Biometric Monitoring, as well as data integration and analysis for online marketing, human resources, and operations.

## Readings and Materials

Required: 
1.	Larsen, Kai and Dan Becker (2017), Automated Machine Learning for Business: Delivering on the 10x Promise. This is an in-process textbook.
2.	USEReady (2017), A Practitioner’s Guide to Alteryx 11 (only available on the Kindle app — Kindle app may be installed on all platforms). $29.95.
3.	DataRobot Access Card, Must be bought at the CU bookstore. $105.95. This will give you access to a lot of computing power that would otherwise bog down your machine, sometimes for days at a time. 
	We use this approach partially because students with expensive computers may in the past have had an unfair advantage in this class and because DataRobot is the premier AutoML on the market.
	
Not required:
4.	Provost, Foster and Tom Fawcett (2013), Data Science for Business: What You Need to Know About Data Mining and Data-Analytic Thinking. O’Reilly Media. Available as Kindle version for $18.35—note that you do not require a Kindle to read the book. Kindle is available as software for your computer or iPad. Hardcopy available on Amazon for $33.63.   (**not required, but one of the best-selling books in industry right now**)

## Learning Objectives

After taking this class, students will:

		-	Combining algorithms through ensemble learning
-	Be able to evaluate the quality of a BA solution
	+	General dangers:
		-	Overfitting
		-	Target leakage
		-	Unbalanced classes
		-	Unequal cost and profits
			•	Profit curves
		-	Baseline performance
	+	Measures of quality:

-	Ethics
	+	Privacy of data
	+	Leaving important decisions to algorithms
	+	Institutionalizing bias

| Help others succeed	|	5% |

### Exams

The exams will be designed primarily to assess your mastery of concepts. I will illustrate how the concepts relate to business situations by showing examples from the real world. Finally, in addition to the group project, you will be occasionally given in-class assignments for you to work on in teams. We will discuss the solutions at the end of class. Occasionally, opportunities will be given by asking for volunteers beforehand to summarize certain readings for the following class. These are generally regarded as extra credit


### Projects

Projects are a critical part of the course.  Projects will be completed by teams of two-three persons [no four-person teams]. You may not have the same teammates on any of the three big projects, so if you have someone you love working with in class, save them for the second or third, higher-yield projects.

The projects will consist of exploratory and predictive tasks where the teams will examine real data from organizations to understand their problems.  We will participate in two Kaggle.com international predictive analytics competitions.

In addition to learning in detail about business analytics and sharing it with the class, another objective of the project is to develop the ability to work well in groups, e.g., distribute work based on your relative strengths, discuss and exchange ideas, build synergies, etc. 

Your individual project grade will be partially determined by your project partners. Each team member will objectively and fairly assess all members in the group (including yourself) and distribute points out of 100.


### Class Conduct, Participation, and Involvement

_Note: This class starts at a breakneck pace, and transferring in after the second class requires instructor approval._ 

I will often ask you questions, and I encourage you to ask me questions. The reason for me asking questions is not to put you on the spot or make you feel uncomfortable, but rather to give you practice to think on your feet quickly in a friendly environment. If, for some reason, you feel uncomfortable with this, please see me, and we will discuss how to help you overcome this. 10% of the class grade explicitly represents class participation and involvement, so regular attendance and participation is important. Half of the participation grade is based on your usefulness to other students (including in the other section of the class). Finally, I start the class at the exact time listed, so punctuality is a must. 


### Class Slides 

Copies of the slides, usually in Powerpoint files (.ppt files), Adobe Acrobat files (.pdf) or some times in MS Word (.doc), will be available on CULearn 15 minutes before class (or earlier on days of awesomeness). For a few classes where content surprises are important, I will not share slides until after class.


### Assignments 

Note -- this is wrong. Assignments will be submitted on canvas or on whatever is being used. TODO -- FIX.

All assignments and reports must be handed in on time and in hard copy (I know…). There will be labs to be done individually unless stated otherwise.  I do not accept email submissions unless explicitly stated otherwise, mostly to reduce the risk of spreading virus and malware. Late submissions cannot be accepted unless there is a real emergency (interviews do not fall into this category) and prior permission of the instructor has been obtained. 

_Finally, please write your name and email address on all submissions._

If you cannot make it to an exam due to an emergency, it is your responsibility to notify me, and schedule a makeup exam before or after the time of the regular exam at my discretion by contacting me on phone or in person. Failure to do so will mean getting a zero score on that exam.

You may appeal any score on an exam or an assignment, but such appeal must be made in writing or in person within one week from the time the exam or homework is returned to the class.


# Schedule

I have tentatively planned for having two or three guest speakers. We might have to make changes on account of guest speakers and for other reasons. Also, in case I have to travel for a professional meeting or presentation, I will make alternative arrangements for my absence. 


## Mind-maps from reading

These are graded based on completenss of knowledge included. Whever you are asked to read a chapter, a mindmap is due on the day of the reading. You may use whatever mindmap tool you like.


## Alteryx workflows

Any time the Alteryx book chapter asks you to develop a workflow, turn this in to D2L. If multiple workflows are expected, turn them in separately with names clearly indicating the task.
