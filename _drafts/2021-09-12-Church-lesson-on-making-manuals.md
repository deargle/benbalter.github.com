These are notes on a lesson I taught to a class older youth on my views of how
lesson manuals are created in the church. I am in a Sunday school presidency
again (yay!), so I have the opportunity to cover lessons for teachers of
various classes from time to time.

- Opened with a story about hearing *name redacted* hold up Come Follow Me to the
  square and testify that it is the Word of God.
  - My eye twitched. I asked myself why?
  - Who writes the manuals? _The Church_ does.
    - The Church is an organization. How can an organization be the author of
      anything?
      - _committees_ write the manuals.
      - The Come Follow Me curriculum was written by committees[^1].
  - Story about how Maren and I were assigned by our stake presidency to create a process for managing
    libraries shared by multiple wards (and therefore multiple librarians) for our specific church building.
    - We scoured the church handbooks for guidance for this situation, but found none.
    - We created the concept of an "agent librarian" -- it is well-known at
      any given time who a building's "agent bishop" is. That bishop's ward's librarians are the "agent librarians." All orders for supplies are to be
      placed by the agent librarians. Librarians from other wards go through the
      agent librarian to submit requests.
    - I created a flow chart in Visio, using skills learned in a
      Systems Development and Design class.
    - We submitted the plan to the stake presidency. They thanked us, and we didn't hear back.
    - Years later, when we were assigned library duties in Pittsburgh, we looked in the handbook and noticed that it had been updated with the concept of "agent librarians." I recall it being a refined version of what we had submitted.
      - Who wrote that?
        - I did, dang it! Maren and I did!
          - Then where were our names next to it in the manual?
        - The _church_ wrote it. Did they?
          - Yes, they did. The church, as an organization, wrote it. Our suggestion was submitted to one committee (the stake presidency), and it likely passed through other committees, and was eventually refined and published. That whole process describes how an _organization_ can be the author of _anything_.
  - Story about the manual writer who inserted a deadpan joke reflection question into a
    church new testament study guide asking readers whether they had ever taught content
    so boring as to cause anyone to fall asleep, and how did that feel? And how his immediate
    supervisor didn't catch the joke, and neither did the person above them, and how the joke
    author panicked and confessed lest the joke actually make it all the way through review
    and get published for real.
      - I _really_ need to find the source for this. It's apocryphal at this point, I'm
        sure I've transformed it. I heard it likely over ten years ago from I-don't-remember-where.
- Introduction to theories of Organizational Behavior.
  - Drew on my phd seminars at Pitt.
  - Organizations _as_ individuals verses individuals _within_ organizations.
  - Organizations as individuals
    - If you remove all of the people from an organization, what remains?
      - Organizational structure, including hierarchical reporting structures
      - Written policies, handbooks
      - Mission statements
      - Assets -- buildings, intellectual properties, business contracts, bank accounts
    - Written policies and handbooks are the most relevant for this lessons.
    - Consider, what was left of the Book of Mormon-era church?
      - Just its records -- the scriptures.
- It can theoretically be possible to carry on an organization just with following written policies.
  - If this isn't possible, then to carry on as before, it's required for a newcomer to "shadow" or "apprentice" experienced organizational insiders
  - This is similar to the difference between "codified" and "tacit" knowledge
    - Exercise: How do you make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich? Explain
      it in sufficient detail that someone with _no other knowledge besides what
      you communicate_ can perform the task.
      - This is how robots are programmed. No assumptions allowed!
    - More relevant exercise: imagine someone is joining the church, and they
      are asked to teach a lesson. Provide explicit steps they
      can follow to prepare a lesson.
      - It can be very difficult for the youth to articulate everything they've
        implicitly learned about how to do church things over their years of experiences in church.
- Activity: I divided them into groups of about 3-4 people, and I called them a "committee." I assigned them to come up with a way to prepare a single lesson.
  - Helpful theories from pedagogy[^2]: learning outcomes.
    - brief exposure to the categories of outcome verbs
    - each verb is one bullet
  - We noted on the board the ideas they came up with
  - We deliberated (in a constructive way) over specific wording they suggested.
    This was to illustrate how committees can refine proposed content, and try to come to consensus.
- Activity: Review the lesson for today: Come Follow Me, Doctrine and Covenants Section 89 (IIRC).
  - The youth had said in the previous lesson that should be grouped by "ideas" (principles).
  - How is this lesson organized?
    - The section headings in the lessons are, indeed, principles.
      - I asked them something scandalous -- did they agree with each of the
        principles as stated by the section headings? Did the source material
        support the wording of the header?
        - I argued that one of the headers/principles about "the Atonement"
          conflicted with a teaching by then-Elder Nelson about "there being
          no such amorphous entity as an atonement on which we can call for succor and grace. It is _Christ_ who heals," etc. [^3]
      - How many principles are in this lesson? (4). Are there more than 4
        principles in the section? (Are there less?) Consensus was that there are _many many_ more than 4. How, then were these 4 chosen? How many
        principles do the other lessons have? (Generally 3 or 4). Why? :shrug:
- I closed by assuring them that I do believe that Christ leads the church -- just that I believe that for our development, he asks us to do our best to work things out on our own.
- I tried to end the meeting without a prayer, as we were over time, but the sunday school president (who was in attendance) would not stand for that. I'm just glad he let me go so "off the handbook rails" during the lesson!

[^2]: Is this an example of "principles of men mingled with scripture?" If so,
      aren't we often tasked with general goals, and asked to do the best we can to
      accomplish them? How can we accomplish goals in a vacuum without applying our own
      ideas? Isn't it held that all truth comes from God, including therefore some "principles of men"?
