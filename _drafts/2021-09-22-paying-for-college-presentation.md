This is a collection of notes for a presentation I gave to a young women's class on 2021-09-22.


# Ways to pay for college

.gov website lists these, too.

1. Grants
1. Scholarships
1. Loans
1. Working


## Working

* One philosophy is to increase hours worked per week the longer you are in
  college.
* Don't work so much that you get bad grades and have to retake credits ($$!) or
  that you lose merit-based scholarships!

## Scholarships

* Types:
  * Internal to the university
    * Different levels:
      * University-level
        * merit-based
      * College-level
        * Once you're accepted to a degree program, the degree college may have
          scholarships available.
      * Program-level
        * Clubs, honors
    * Money comes from donations
      * Who donates? Individuals.
        * Why?
          * Tax deductible
          * Philanthropy, altruism.
        * Charitable organizations and non-profits compete for the donation dollars of persons interested in donating a fixed amount
  * External scholarships
    * From private organizations
      * Why do private organizations give scholarships?
        * Not altriusm! (Not directly, at least.)
          * Corporations don't do anything for altriusm. Corporations are profit-driven.
        * Corporate Social Responsibility
          * To attract and retain employees. Many employees want to work for a company whose actions align with their personal ethos.
        * Tax deductible
          * Assuming IRS rules are followed!
            * Money given preferentially to employees (as a benefit of employment) not tax deductible -- becomes taxes like salary and payroll.
            * Money given preferentially to dependents of organizational managers can be penalized as self-service.
            * Organizations have to submit a granting-plan to the IRS in advance. Then, they have to follow it.
              * Sweepstakes?
                * Lottery-based. Highly promoted on scholarship-listing websites.
              * Essays, interviews
                * Interviewers are most concerned that they appear to be following the IRS plan.
* How to find scholarships?
  * Scholarships from local organizations
    * These organizations want to advertise their scholarships. How do they advertise?
    * Check the websites of local high schools (not just your high school).
  * tons of scholarship-listing websites
    * what is their business model?
      * charge companies to list their scholarships
      * advertisements on webpage
      * commissions on student loans
* Decision criteria:
  * financial-needs-based
  * first-generation college
  * seeking specific majors
  * race/ethnicity, gender, persons with disabilities, veterans, and other underrepresented and underserved populations
  * sweepstakes

## Grants

* From federal government
  * PELL Grants, determined by financial need. No need to repay
  * Other grants that _conditionally_ don't need to repay. agree to work in high-need areas.
    * teaching
    * medical


## Loans

* federal loans -- subsidized vs unsubsidized
  * Interest rates usually pretty good
  * limited total grantable amounts (based on FASFA?)
  * subsidized
    * govt pays interest on your subsidized loans until a certain time
    * lower interest rates
    * limited by annual amounts
  * unsubsidized
    * interest starts accruing immediately
    * still might be worth it
  * how much do you need to borrow?
    * Consider reducing living expenses first.
      * Evangelize something like YNAB.
  * how much is "okay"? How much is "worth it?"
    * College costs as a "Return on investment"
    * **Monthly loan payments should be no more than 10% expected first-year take-home pay.**
      * lots of calculators online
    * how much does a career pay? Check out the bureau of labor statistics
      * but these are medians
* beware compound interest
  * credit cards are basically loans with horrible interest rates


# How did I learn this?

* General internet searches are full of shill content mills that game search
  engine results
* Find an online community -- reddit, facebook.
  * I searched "reddit scholarships" and found
    <https://www.reddit.com/r/scholarships/>
    * community members / voters might be grassroots people, might be actual
      people.
    * try to find reliable information.
      * posts get voted on. Sort posts by "top"
      * find the top influencers on the community -- the people with the most
        upvotes. look at posts. Sort comments on a post by "top". Examine user
        history for people who seem like they know what they're talking about
        * user "how2winscholarships" seemed to be giving good information
          * I search this user's comment history. They had posted links to their
            own website, <https://how2winscholarships.com/>
            * Was this reliable information?
              * What's the website business model?
                * ads
                * subsidized loans
              * Looking past the ads, the general information and principles seemed legit
* college financial office websites often link helpful information.
  * BYU's website had some good information. Since they're an
    undergraduate-focused uni whose mission is not profit-driven (and since I
    don't think there's some bigger conspiracy going on there), I trust the info
    to be well-intentioned, written in good faith.
* `.gov` websites are good
  * in theory, their business model is not you as a customer, but you as a
    contributor to society, so the information is more reliable?

# Hinckley quotes

Gordon Hinckley was the President of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day
Saints when I was growing up.  He would often make statements imploring the
youth to get a good education. His statements were highly impactful on me, and I
still like them. Here's my favorite one. I call it the "not a thief" quote:

> I do not care what you want to be as long as it is honorable. A car mechanic, a brick layer, a plumber, an electrician, a doctor, a lawyer, a merchant, but not a thief. But whatever you are, take the opportunity to train for it and make the best of that opportunity. Society will reward you according to your worth as it perceives that worth. Now is the great day of preparation for each of you. If it means sacrifice, then sacrifice. That sacrifice will become the best investment you have ever made, for you will reap returns from it all the days of your lives.

> From <https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/teachings-of-presidents-of-the-church-gordon-b-hinckley/chapter-17-continue-in-the-great-process-of-learning?lang=eng>

A note on this: My high school guidance counselors would often say "go to
college!", but Hinckley's quotes _don't say "college"_ -- rather, they say
"education." Where my guidance counselors would say "educate your mind," Hinckley
says to educate the mind _and_ hands. It was a refreshingly expansive view for me.

Two other representative quotes from him:

> It is so important that you young men and you young women get all of the education that you can. â€¦ Education is the key which will unlock the door of opportunity for you. It is worth sacrificing for. It is worth working at, and if you educate your mind and your hands, you will be able to make a great contribution to the society of which you are a part, and you will be able to reflect honorably on the Church of which you are a member. My dear young brothers and sisters, take advantage of every educational opportunity that you can possibly afford, and you fathers and mothers, encourage your sons and daughters to gain an education which will bless their lives. [10]

> Perhaps you do not have the funds to get all the schooling you would desire. Make your money go as far as you can, and take advantage of scholarships, grants, and loans within your capacity to repay. [11]
