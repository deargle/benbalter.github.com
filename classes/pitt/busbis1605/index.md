# Course Information

## Course Description

This course provides a basic understanding of information management in organizations and specifically the design and use of database systems. Topics include data modeling, relational databases, and structured query language. The course is divided into four sections: (1) information management concepts and procedures for Web-based systems; (2) data modeling and database design; (3) data analytics; (4) data management.

_The course syllabus is a general plan for the course; deviations announced to the class by the instructor may be necessary._

## Text

Watson, R. T. (2013). [Data management: databases and organizations](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00E8HS8N2) (6th ed.). Athens, GA: eGreen Press. **I recommend the Kindle version.** [Textbook website](http://richardtwatson.com/dm6e/).

## Software

We will use [MySQL Workbench](http://www.mysql.com/products/workbench/) for data modeling and SQL execution (available on Windows, Linux, and Mac OS X). Macintosh owners can also use [Sequel Pro](http://www.sequelpro.com/) for SQL execution.

### MySQL database

1. Laptop for individual assignments and exams: <br>
   Download and install [MySQL Community Server](http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/) (or, if you're interested in Web Dev, [WAMP](http://www.wampserver.com/en/) or [MAMP](https://www.mamp.info/en/))<br>
1. Server for SQL exercises: <br> 
    Hostname: mysql.daveeargle.com. Username and password on CourseWeb. Default schema: Text.
1. Server for group work <br>
   Hostname: mysql.daveeargle.com. You will get a group id and password.

### R
1. Server connection parameters TBA


## Policies

### Group size
Groups should contain between three and four persons.

### Communication
I will send messages via CourseWeb. Feel free to [contact me]({% link contact.md %}) outside of CourseWeb.

### Academic honesty
Students in this course will be expected to comply with the [University of Pittsburgh's Policy on Academic Integrity](http://www.cfo.pitt.edu/policies/policy/02/02-03-02.html). Any student suspected of violating this obligation for any reason during the semester will be required to participate in the procedural process, initiated at the instructor level, as outlined in the University Guidelines on Academic Integrity. This may include, but is not limited to, the confiscation of the examination of any individual suspected of violating University Policy. Furthermore, no student may bring any unauthorized materials to an exam, including dictionaries and programmable calculators.

### Team work
In this class, you will work in teams. As a result, review a short report on [team effectiveness]({{site.baseurl}}/class/general/team_effectiveness.pdf) and establish a team agreement [(sample agreement)]({{ site.baseurl }}/class/general/sample_team_agreement.docx). Give the instructor a copy of your team agreement by the end of the second week of classes.


### Freeloader policy
It occasionally happens in class and enterprise settings that someone in a group is not prepared to do his/her share. In the case of my classes, I recommend that the team give the freeloader one warning and then fire that person from the team. That person will then do group assignments individually or find another team to join. The team should notify me of the change in team composition immediately. I distribute a [form]({{site.baseurl}}/class/general/Peereval.docx) to assess team participation at the end of the semester. If a major disparity in team contribution is reported, I will adjust team project grades.

### Laptop policy 
Students are welcome to use laptops in class for note taking and completing class exercises, exclusively. If you plan to take notes, please advise and email a copy of the notes at the end of each class.


### Attendance
Attendance and participation are required for this course. Excessive unexcused absences (i.e., greater than 4) will result in a failing grade according to [University of Pittsburgh policies](http://www.bulletins.pitt.edu/archive/education/eh.html)

# Assignments
See the class schedule for the due date. The due time is 11:59pm on the due date.

## Exercises (on your own)

* SQL exercises are based on the [ClassicModels database](http://richardtwatson.com/dm6e/Reader/ClassicModels.html).
* Please use the assignment identifier so I can keep track of your submissions. As I have many assignments to grade, help me to be efficient.
* **Resubmission**: If you receive less than full points for an exercise, you can make one resubmission up to one week after the intital due date for the first three assignments.
* Please submit via CourseWeb and **follow the specificied [assignment guidelines]({{ site.baseurl }}/class/general/assignment_guidelines/)**.

## State of the art presentations (group) (there will be two per class).

A presentation is required from each group on a data management technology, with a particular concentration on open source products.

* You will give a 10 minute class presentation directed at your fellow class members.
* Points will be deducted for exceeding 10 minutes.
* The presentation should focus on the applications of the selected technology and the business opportunities it provides.
* Spend no more than 3 minutes, if you judge it necessary, describing or demonstrating how the technology works.
* A video should not be a substitute for your presentation but should augment it to visualize a point you cannot present otherwise.
* No handouts (save the trees), but you can share a link to your presentation with me (the professor), and I'll share it with the  class.

Some suggested topics are listed below (assigned topics have a date of presentation), and you can propose other topics. You should submit your bid for a topic via [e-mail]({% link contact.md %}). When submitting a bid, also specify your team's name. Those who bid early present early.

## Database design and implementation project #1 (group)

Cell phones have replaced landlines in many situations, except hotels, yet the guests of most hotels have a cell phone. Design the database for an app to replace a room's <a href='https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iKqusrW1mp-yhRWcFXtYy0_5P0UfMBI_2ZoGZH8sAOE/edit?usp=sharing' target='_blank'>landline and the various paper documentation you find in a hotel room</a>. Convert the data model to a relational database and write 10 queries to access the database. The queries should demonstrate your breadth of understanding of SQL (i.e., 10 simple queries will not score as well as say 4 simple queries and 6 nontrivial queries).

Follow the [guidelines for database project submissions]({{ site.baseurl }}/class/general/dbguidelines/).

Data modeling is difficult and to facilitate learning an initial model must be submitted previous to the due date (see the schedule).


## Database design and implementation project #2 (group)

Develop a data model for an application of your choice. The problem must be at least of the same order of magnitude as for project #1. Please discuss your proposed project with the instructor before making substantial progress. You must file a brief written outline of the project's scope. You might find an [examplar project](http://people.terry.uga.edu/rwatson/general/exemplar.pdf) and [associated data](http://people.terry.uga.edu/rwatson/general/exemplar.xlsx) useful for this assignment.

An initial model must be submitted previous to the due date (see the schedule).

Follow the [guidelines for database project submissions]({{ site.baseurl }}/class/general/dbguidelines/) .
