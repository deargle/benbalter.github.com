You should supply the following:

1. Your team name and the names of its members
1. A one paragraph description of the problem
1. The data model in png format (File > Export > Export as PNG...)
1. The name of the database on the MySQL server
1. Ten queries
    * A natural language description of the query
    * The SQL and the results (Query -> Execute (All or Selection) to Text)
    * Copy and paste the results into a word processing document so that everything is in one document.
1. The ten queries should cover the following SQL features:
    * multiple table join
    * subquery
    * correlated subquery
    * GROUP BY
    * GROUP BY with HAVING
    * ORDER BY
    * Divide
    * IN or NOT IN
    * A built-in function (e.g., AVG) or a calculated field
    * REGEXP
    * EXISTS or NOT EXISTS, other than in divide
1. You may combine some of the preceding list of features into a single query. Indicate in matrix format in your report which features are covered in a query. A sample matrix is shown:

<div style='width:50%'> 
<table class='table table-bordered'>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>&nbsp;</td>
      <td>Query 1</td>
      <td>Query 2</td>
      <td>...</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>multiple table join</td>
      <td>x</td>
      <td>&nbsp;</td>
      <td>&nbsp;</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>subquery</td>
      <td>x</td>
      <td>x</td>
      <td>&nbsp;</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>...</td>
      <td>&nbsp;</td>
      <td>x</td>
      <td>&nbsp;</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
</div>

* Submit a PDF report containing all the above as a single file.
